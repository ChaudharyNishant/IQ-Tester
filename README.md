# IQ-Tester
An android game to test your IQ
<br><br>The game brings the smartness, logic and patience at one place and helps you be a little brainy-brainy-boi. Challenge your family, friends and colleagues and see who's the smartest person in the room.
<br><br><h3>Rules</h3>
<br>Like checkers, the point of the game is to jump pegs and remove them from the game. The rules are simple:
<ul>
  <li>To jump a peg, it must have an empty space next to it.</li>
  <li>You can use any peg as a jumper, as long as the peg you jump is directly adjacent to it and has an open space next to it.</li>
  <li>Every peg you jump must be removed.</li>
  <li>You win when there is only one peg left.</li>
</ul>
