# IQ-Tester
An android game to test your IQ

The game brings the smartness, logic and patience at one place and helps you be a little brainy-brainy-boi. Challenge your family, friends and colleagues and see who's the smartest person in the room.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Like checkers, the point of the game is to jump pegs and remove them from the game. The rules are simple:
- To jump a peg, it must have an empty space next to it.
- You can use any peg as a jumper, as long as the peg you jump is directly adjacent to it and has an open space next to it.
- Every peg you jump must be removed.
- You win when there is only one peg left.
