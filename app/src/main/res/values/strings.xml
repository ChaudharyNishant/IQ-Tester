    <string name="inst">The idea behind the game is to remove the Xs such that minimum number of Xs are left at last.
    First, 1 X of the 15 Xs is removed and then the way to play is to jump another X into an empty space adjacent to the X that is being jumped over.
        After the jump is completed, the X that is jumped over is removed from the triangle.</string>
